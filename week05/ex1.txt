In the exercise we need to create n named pipes for n subscribers. Each named pipe represents a communication channel. The reason for creating n named pipes subscribers is to ensure that each subscriber gets its own messages from the publisher. If all subscribers use the same named pipe, they all read messages from the same pipe and the collision could occurs, and there could be pieces of message in different subscribers. This is because when a message is read from a pipe, it is consumed and no longer available to other readers.
