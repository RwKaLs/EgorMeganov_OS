In the exercise we need to create n named pipes for n subscribers. Each named pipe represents a unique communication channel. The reason for creating n named pipes subscribers is to ensure that each subscriber gets its own messages from the publisher. If all subscribers use the same named pipe, they all read messages from the same pipe and get same messages. This is because when a message is read from a pipe, it is consumed and no longer available to other readers. Therefore, having a separate named pipe for each subscriber ensures that every subscriber can read all messages sent by the publisher.
