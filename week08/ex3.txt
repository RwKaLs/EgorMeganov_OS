When running the program in the background and observing the memory with vmstat 1,
we can see that the memory usage increases every second as the program allocates more memory.
The 'si' and 'so' fields in vmstat output represent the amount of memory swapped in from disk ('si') and out to disk ('so').
If these values are high, it indicates that the system is swapping a lot of data due to insufficient physical memory.
In our case, if there's enough physical memory available, these values should remain low.
