The monitor.c program would have reported an event for myfile11.txt when its content was modified. This is because myfile11.txt is a hard link to myfile1.txt, and they share the same inode. When we modify one, we're actually modifying the content of the inode, so the change is reflected in all hard links. Therefore, the monitor.c program, which watches for changes in the directory, would detect this change.

Еhe monitor.c program would not have reported an event for myfile13.txt when /tmp/myfile1.txt was modified. This is because myfile13.txе is a symbolic link, not a hard link. A symbolic link has its own inode and points to the path of the target file, not the inode of the target file. Therefore, changes to the target file /tmp/myfile1.txt would not be detected by the monitor.c program through the symbolic link myfile13.txt.

  After removing all duplicates of hard links to myfile11.txt in the watched directory, the stat info of the kept hard link (myfile11.txt) would show that the number of links (st_nlink) has decreased. This is because st_nlink represents the number of hard links to a file, and by removing the duplicates, you are reducing this number. The st_nlink value would now be 1, indicating that there is only one hard link to the inode.
