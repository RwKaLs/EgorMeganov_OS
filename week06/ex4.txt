The Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm cycles through processes, giving each a fixed time quantum. This can lead to more context switches but provides a better balance of response time. The Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm prioritizes processes with shorter burst times, potentially reducing waiting and turnaround times. The First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) algorithm executes processes in the order they arrive. The specific differences in output depend on the processes being scheduled.
