Changing the `TRI_BASE` macro to a smaller number like 100 would affect the range of
numbers that the `big_n` function can generate. It means that the worker processes
searches for triangular numbers in a smaller range, which could potentially
make them find triangular numbers more quickly.

If the arrival time of all processes is zero, then all processes are ready to run
at the start of the simulation. Due to FCFS scheduling algorithm, the order
of execution of the processes determines by their order in the process array.
The process at index 0 would run first, followed by the process at index 1, and so on.
This is because FCFS treats all ready-to-run processes as a queue and executes them
in the order they were added to the queue.
